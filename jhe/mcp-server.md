title: MCP Server
---

The JHE MCP Server (`jhe_mcp`) exposes JupyterHealth Exchange (JHE) data to LLM clients (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, and any other [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) client) so a user can query their studies, patients, and observations in natural language.

This page is the single onboarding doc for the MCP server: how it works, how to register it with JHE, how to configure and deploy it, and how to connect an LLM client. The server acts as an **OAuth broker** - it presents an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server interface to MCP clients while delegating the actual login to JHE. Because JHE enforces per-user RBAC, each user only sees the studies, patients, and observations they are already authorized to access; the MCP server inherits those boundaries automatically.

The server lives in the [`mcp_server/`](https://github.com/jupyterhealth/jupyterhealth-exchange/tree/main/mcp_server) directory of the JHE repository and is an **optional, standalone service** - it is deployed independently and is not part of a JHE deployment.

> In the examples below, replace `<your-mcp-host>` with the public host of your MCP server. The current reference/dev deployment runs on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) at `https://jhe-mcp.fly.dev`; treat that URL as an example, not a stable public service.

## Architecture

The MCP server sits between an LLM client and JHE. It never holds long-lived credentials for the end user: the user logs in at JHE, JHE issues tokens, and the server forwards those tokens to JHE's REST/FHIR APIs on the user's behalf.

```
LLM Client (e.g. Claude Desktop)
        │  MCP over Streamable HTTP (/mcp)
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         JHE MCP Server               │
│  OAuth Broker (Authorization façade) │
│  MCP Tools (studies, patients, obs)  │
└────────────┬─────────────────────────┘
             │  OAuth 2.0 + REST/FHIR API calls
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│       JupyterHealth Exchange         │
│  Authorization Server (django-oauth- │
│  toolkit + OIDC + PKCE)              │
│  RBAC enforced per user              │
│  Data: studies / patients / obs      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Flow:**

1. The LLM client connects to the MCP server's Streamable HTTP endpoint (`/mcp`) and initiates OAuth.
1. The MCP server redirects the user to **JHE's own login screen**.
1. The user enters **their own** JHE credentials; JHE issues an authorization code to the MCP server.
1. The MCP server exchanges the code for JHE tokens and hands them back to the client. The server is **stateless** - it stores no tokens; the client holds and refreshes them.
1. Subsequent MCP tool calls carry the user's token, which the server forwards to JHE REST/FHIR API requests - RBAC is enforced entirely by JHE.

> **Two distinct OAuth identities - don't conflate them:**
>
> - **MCP server ↔ JHE:** the MCP server is a **confidential** OAuth client of JHE, holding `JHE_CLIENT_ID` + `JHE_CLIENT_SECRET`. These live **only in the server deployment** (e.g. Fly secrets) and are never seen by end users.
> - **LLM client ↔ MCP server:** the LLM client authenticates to the broker as a **public** client - a `client_id` only, **no secret**. The end user's actual identity is established by logging in at JHE with their own credentials.

The server speaks the modern MCP **Streamable HTTP transport** at `/mcp` and implements **OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration (DCR, RFC 7591)** plus discovery metadata (RFC 9728 / RFC 8414). Clients **connect directly to the URL and register themselves** - no bridge and no manually-issued client ID required.

### Error responses - an outage is not a bad token

The server returns `401` **only** when JHE actually rejects the token. If JHE cannot be reached, or answers the validation call wrongly, the token was never checked - so the server answers with a `5xx` and **no `WWW-Authenticate` header**, because that header is what tells a client to discard its token and re-authenticate.

| Response                      | Meaning                                                                | What the client should do                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `401` with `WWW-Authenticate` | JHE rejected the token - expired, revoked, or issued to another client | Re-authenticate                              |
| `503` with `Retry-After`      | JHE unreachable, throttling, or erroring - transient                   | **Keep the token** and retry after the delay |
| `500`                         | Misconfiguration (e.g. a stale `JHE_BASE_URL`); retrying will not help | Keep the token; surface it to an operator    |

The `5xx` bodies carry the OAuth error vocabulary - `temporarily_unavailable` and `server_error` - in the same `{"error", "error_description"}` shape as the `401`. A client that treats *any* auth failure as "log the user out" will sign users out during a JHE outage, so branch on the status code rather than on failure alone.

## Registering the OAuth Client in JHE

The MCP server must be registered as an OAuth 2.0 **confidential** client in the JHE instance it will talk to. There are two ways to do this. In the URLs below, replace `<jhe-host>` with your JHE instance's host.

> **Do not use JHE's portal "Clients" page for this.** That page creates a public client with a fixed `{SITE_URL}/auth/callback` redirect URI and cannot issue a `client_secret`. Use one of the two admin paths below instead.

### Option A - Self-service (any admin/staff user)

Navigate to `https://<jhe-host>/o/applications/register/`, log in with a staff or superuser account, fill in the fields from the table below, and save.

### Option B - Django admin (superuser)

Navigate to `https://<jhe-host>/admin/oauth2_provider/application/add/` and fill in the same fields. The admin form also exposes a **User** field - set it to the admin user creating the record, or leave it blank.

### Field values

| Field                     | Value                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Name                      | `JHE MCP Server`                         |
| Client type               | `Confidential`                           |
| Authorization grant type  | `Authorization code`                     |
| Redirect URIs             | `https://<your-mcp-host>/oauth/callback` |
| Algorithm                 | `RSA with SHA-256 (RS256)`               |
| Post logout redirect URIs | *(leave blank)*                          |
| Allowed origins           | *(leave blank)*                          |
| User *(admin form only)*  | the admin user creating it, or blank     |

> **Copy the `client_secret` immediately after saving.** django-oauth-toolkit 3.x hashes the secret on save and never displays it again. If you lose it, you must regenerate a new one.

> **PKCE (S256)** is enforced globally via the `PKCE_REQUIRED` setting in JHE - it is not a per-application field and does not need to be configured here.

### Reproducible JHE-side seeding (optional)

Manual registration above is a one-time setup. To make the broker's JHE OAuth application **reproducible** - so a fresh `python manage.py seed` recreates it (as a confidential client with `skip_authorization=True`, i.e. no consent prompt) instead of needing the admin UI - set the **same** credentials on the **JHE deployment** too:

```bash
# on the JHE deployment
MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
MCP_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
# optional: set to match your MCP host's /oauth/callback.
# Defaults to https://jhe-mcp.fly.dev/oauth/callback, so non-reference deployments must set it.
MCP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://<your-mcp-host>/oauth/callback
```

`seed.py::seed_mcp_broker_application` reads these and creates/updates the `JHE MCP Server` application; when they are unset (local/CI seeds) it is skipped. They must match the `JHE_CLIENT_ID` / `JHE_CLIENT_SECRET` set on the MCP server (see [Configuration](#configuration)) so the broker can authenticate against the seeded record.

## Configuration

The server is configured entirely via environment variables (or secrets in production).

| Variable                | Required | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JHE_BASE_URL`          | Yes      | Base URL of the JHE instance (e.g. `https://jhe.fly.dev`). This is what aims the server at a particular JHE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `JHE_CLIENT_ID`         | Yes      | The broker's **confidential** OAuth client ID at JHE (server-side only; never given to end users or LLM clients).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `JHE_CLIENT_SECRET`     | No       | The broker's confidential client secret at JHE. You do not pick this value - JHE generates it: django-oauth-toolkit pre-fills the **Client secret** field on the registration form (see [Registering the OAuth Client](#registering-the-oauth-client-in-jhe)), and copy it immediately because it is hashed on save and never shown again. Required for a confidential client; recommended. |
| `MCP_RESOURCE_URL`      | Yes      | Public URL of this MCP server (e.g. `https://<your-mcp-host>`). Must be the server's own public URL. **If unset it silently defaults to the reference host `https://jhe-mcp.fly.dev`** rather than erroring - so every non-reference deployment must set it, or its discovery metadata (RFC 9728 / RFC 8414) will advertise the reference host instead of itself.                           |
| `MCP_BROKER_KEY`        | Yes      | Random secret used to encrypt OAuth state and authorization codes. **Must be at least 32 characters** or the server refuses to start. Generate with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"` (yields ~43 characters).                                                                                                                                                 |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_REDIRECTS` | No       | Comma-separated list of non-loopback redirect URIs to allow (for additional MCP client types).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT`         | No       | Port the HTTP server listens on (default: `8401`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `MCP_REQUIRE_AUDIENCE`  | No       | When `true`, reject tokens whose audience can't be confirmed via JHE introspection (fail closed). Default `false` (dev): fall back to userinfo-only validation. Set `true` in production.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Connecting an LLM Client

Clients connect directly to the server URL and register themselves via DCR. On first connect the user is sent to **JHE's own login page**; after they sign in, the client caches and refreshes the JHE-issued token automatically. **The end user supplies nothing but their JHE login** - in every client below the only value you provide is the server URL, `https://<your-mcp-host>/mcp`.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http jhe https://<your-mcp-host>/mcp
```

The first tool call opens JHE's login in your browser. Verify with `claude mcp list` / `claude mcp get jhe`.

### Claude Desktop

Add a connector via **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, with URL `https://<your-mcp-host>/mcp`. (Recent desktop builds support remote connectors with OAuth + DCR directly.)

### Google Gemini (Gemini CLI)

In `~/.gemini/settings.json`, use the `httpUrl` field for Streamable HTTP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jhe": {
      "httpUrl": "https://<your-mcp-host>/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)

- **ChatGPT app "Connectors" (developer mode):** add a connector with URL `https://<your-mcp-host>/mcp`. The server advertises the discovery metadata and DCR that ChatGPT expects.
- **Responses / Agents API:** the API does not run the OAuth flow for you - obtain a JHE access token out-of-band and pass it on the `mcp` tool:
  ```json
  {"type": "mcp", "server_label": "jhe", "server_url": "https://<your-mcp-host>/mcp", "authorization": "<JHE access token>", "require_approval": "never"}
  ```

### Fallback: stdio-only clients

For a client that cannot speak remote Streamable HTTP at all, bridge with [`mcp-remote`](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) (it will DCR automatically - no client ID needed):

```bash
npx -y mcp-remote https://<your-mcp-host>/mcp
```

## Deploying

The MCP server ships as a standard **container** (the `Dockerfile` in the `mcp_server/` directory) and runs on any container platform - a plain Docker host, Kubernetes, Cloud Run, ECS, Fly.io, etc. It connects to JHE over the network as an OAuth client (via `JHE_BASE_URL`), so one JHE instance can have zero, one, or several MCP servers pointed at it. Deploying JHE never deploys the MCP server, and JHE is fully functional without it - the only thing absent is LLM/MCP access.

To stand it up against a running JHE instance:

1. **Register the OAuth client** in that JHE - see [Registering the OAuth Client in JHE](#registering-the-oauth-client-in-jhe).
1. **Provide the required environment variables / secrets** via your platform's mechanism - `JHE_BASE_URL`, `JHE_CLIENT_ID`, `JHE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MCP_RESOURCE_URL`, `MCP_BROKER_KEY` (full list in [Configuration](#configuration)).
1. **Build and run the container**, exposing its HTTP port (`8401`) behind TLS. The image builds reproducibly from the committed `uv.lock`:
   ```bash
   docker build -t jhe-mcp .
   docker run -p 8401:8401 --env-file .env jhe-mcp   # or your platform's run/secret mechanism
   ```
1. **Verify** it is healthy:
   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://<your-mcp-host>/health   # expect 200
   ```

To run against a different JHE, change `JHE_BASE_URL` (and the matching client credentials) and redeploy.

### Reference deployment (Fly.io)

The hosted instance runs on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) (app `jhe-mcp`), using the `fly.toml` in the `mcp_server/` directory. Set the secrets from [Configuration](#configuration), then:

```bash
fly secrets set -a jhe-mcp \
  JHE_CLIENT_ID=<client_id> \
  JHE_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret> \
  MCP_BROKER_KEY=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))") \
  MCP_RESOURCE_URL=https://jhe-mcp.fly.dev

fly deploy -a jhe-mcp    # build from uv.lock + deploy
fly logs   -a jhe-mcp    # tail logs
fly status -a jhe-mcp    # machine / image status

The MCP server exposes the following tools to LLM clients. Every tool runs as the authenticated user and only returns data that user is authorized to see.

The observation and patient-search tools use JHE's FHIR search support (the `date` search parameter, `_summary=count`, `_sort`, and the Patient search parameters). **Deploy order matters:** roll out a JHE backend that has this search support before deploying the MCP server against it — an older backend silently ignores unknown search parameters, which corrupts sorted queries rather than merely widening date windows. When the backend publishes a CapabilityStatement (`/FHIR/R5/metadata`), the MCP server checks requested search parameters against it and returns a clear error for unsupported ones instead of letting them be silently ignored; against a backend without the endpoint it falls back to sending them as-is.

**Studies:**

- **`get_study_count`** - Returns the total number of studies the authenticated user can access.
- **`list_studies`** - Lists all studies visible to the authenticated user, with key metadata.
- **`get_study_metadata`** - Retrieves detailed metadata for a specific study by ID.
- **`list_study_patients`** - Lists patients enrolled in a specific study, returning ID, name, and email for each.

**Patients:**

- **`search_patients`** - Finds patients by `name`/`family`/`given` (case-insensitive prefix match; a comma ORs values) and/or `birthdate` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, optional `ge`/`le`/`gt`/`lt` prefix), returning a page of slim demographics. At least one criterion is required; `limit` is capped at 1000.
- **`get_patient_demographics`** - Returns demographic information for a specific patient by patient ID.
- **`get_patient_date_range`** - Returns the earliest and latest observation dates and total count for a patient, using two small server-side sorted probes (no paging through records).

**Observations:**

- **`count_patient_observations`** - Returns the exact observation count for a patient, optionally filtered by OMH data type and date range, without returning records.
- **`count_study_observations`** - Returns the observation count across a whole study in one call; with `by_patient=True` returns a `{patient_id: count}` map.
- **`summarize_patient_observations`** - Returns a compact per-data-type digest for a patient (`{truncated, types: {type: {count, earliest, latest}}}`) - the "show me everything" overview. `truncated: true` means the bounded fetch could not cover every record, so counts are lower bounds.
- **`get_patient_observations`** - Fetches one page of a patient's observations (with total/pagination), optionally filtered by OMH data type and an inclusive `start`/`end` date window (applied server-side, compared in the server's timezone — UTC by default), ordered `newest` (default) or `oldest`; defaults to compact records, with `verbosity="full"` for the raw OMH body.

**OMH schemas:**

- **`get_omh_schema`** - Returns the full OMH JSON schema for a data type by short name (e.g. `heart-rate`, `blood-glucose`). Schemas are also browsable as resources at `omh://schema/<name>`.

**Capabilities:**

- **`get_server_capabilities`** - Returns a digest of the JHE instance's CapabilityStatement (`{available, fhir_version, resources: {type: {interactions, search_params}}}`) so a client can ask what this deployment supports; `available: false` means the instance predates the metadata endpoint.

## Local Development

### Setup

```bash
cd mcp_server
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit
```

### Running the server

Set the required environment variables (see [Configuration](#configuration)) before starting, or create a `.env` file and load it into your shell, then:

```bash
jhe-mcp-http
```
